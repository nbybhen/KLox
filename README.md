# KLox

A tree-walking interpreter of the [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) written in Kotlin. 
The primary purpose of this project is to improve my skills within the language, as well as deepen my theoretical understanding of *interpreters* before 
creating the *compiler* for the Lox language.
